current_state:
  phase: 1
  step: "1.3"
  description: "Phase 1 — Steps 1.1 (scaffolding), 1.2 (database layer), and 1.3 (user profile model) complete"
  working_features:
    - "Config loading from .env via pydantic-settings"
    - "SQLite async database with conversations and user_profiles tables"
    - "Message save/retrieve and profile save/retrieve functions"
    - "Pydantic user profile models (UserProfile, MediaPreferences, NotificationPrefs)"
    - "ProfileManager with async get/save and automatic default profile creation"
  known_issues: []

completed_steps:
  - step: "1.1"
    name: "Project Scaffolding"
    date: "2026-02-13"
    summary: "Created project structure with uv, pydantic-settings AppConfig, .env.example"
    decisions:
      - "Used pydantic-settings for config with env vars"
      - "ALLOWED_TELEGRAM_IDS parses as comma-separated list of ints"
    issues: []

  - step: "1.2"
    name: "SQLite Database Layer"
    date: "2026-02-13"
    summary: "Async SQLite layer with aiosqlite. init_db(), save/get for messages and profiles."
    decisions:
      - "Used aiosqlite for async DB access"
      - "Single file SQLite, sufficient for home server use case"
    issues: []

  - step: "1.3"
    name: "User Profile Model"
    date: "2026-02-13"
    summary: "Pydantic models for user profiles (UserProfile, MediaPreferences, NotificationPrefs) and ProfileManager class with async get/save for database persistence via db.py."
    decisions:
      - "Used model_dump(mode='json') for serialization to ensure datetime/time objects are stored as ISO strings"
      - "ProfileManager uses model_copy() for immutable profile updates rather than in-place mutation"
      - "Default profile template pattern allows customization via constructor injection"
      - "user_id stored as DB key, not in the serialized data blob"
    issues: []

architecture_decisions:
  - id: "AD-001"
    title: "PydanticAI over LangGraph/Haystack"
    date: "2026-02-13"
    decision: "Use PydanticAI as the agent framework"
    rationale: >
      Model-agnostic, native MCP support, history_processors for token cost control,
      dependency injection, Pythonic. LangGraph's interrupt()/graph machinery is overkill —
      Telegram's message flow is the human-in-the-loop. Haystack's pipeline model is
      optimized for RAG, not conversational agents.
    status: final

  - id: "AD-002"
    title: "MCP for Service Integration (Prefer Existing)"
    date: "2026-02-13"
    decision: "Use MCP to connect to home server services. Search for existing community MCP servers first."
    rationale: "Standard protocol, decoupled, reusable. Avoids hand-writing tool wrappers."
    status: final

  - id: "AD-003"
    title: "OpenRouter Free Tier Only"
    date: "2026-02-13"
    decision: "All LLM calls use free-tier models via OpenRouter. $10 top-up for 1000 free requests/day."
    rationale: "Cost constraint. Free models are capable enough. Token management via sliding window + user profile."
    status: final

  - id: "AD-004"
    title: "Evolving User Profile for Personalization"
    date: "2026-02-13"
    decision: "Agent maintains a per-user profile that evolves over time, injected into system prompt."
    rationale: "Token-efficient personalization. Sliding window loses old context but profile persists key observations."
    status: final

  - id: "AD-005"
    title: "Telegram Conversation as Human-in-the-Loop"
    date: "2026-02-13"
    decision: "No programmatic interrupt mechanism. Agent decides when to ask for confirmation via system prompt."
    rationale: "Natural conversational flow. Simpler than LangGraph's interrupt/resume."
    status: final

  - id: "AD-006"
    title: "SQLite for Persistence"
    date: "2026-02-13"
    decision: "SQLite for conversation history and user profiles."
    rationale: "Zero-dependency, single file on disk, sufficient for single/few users on a home server."
    status: final
